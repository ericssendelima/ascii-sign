**Transform plain text into console art with this lightweight and powerful .NET library.**
---

`AsciiSign` lets you render magnificent text directly in your terminal, using carefully designed pixel-matrix fonts. It's perfect for adding a special touch to welcome screens, banners, logs, or any console application that deserves a bit more style.


### 🌟 NEW in v2.0: The `TuringFont` and the `ShadedFont` 🌟

Inspired by the aesthetics of old-school computers and the work of the genius Alan Turing, the `TuringFont` offers a unique, filled, and bold look for your creations.

And don't worry, the classic `ShadedFont` (hollow) is still here for those who love the traditional style!
